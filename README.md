# NLTK_Python
Repository to work with NLTK in Python

Before proceeding to practice with the Python files from this repository, you will need to install NLTK in your machine.
To do so, open the console and type 'pip install nltk'

This repository is based on examples from:
NLTK tutorial with Python by Harrison Kinsley (@sentdex): https://pythonprogramming.net/tokenizing-words-sentences-nltk-tutorial/, NLTK book: http://www.nltk.org/book/ and some personal input, along with comments on what each line of code is actually doing.

Enjoy!
